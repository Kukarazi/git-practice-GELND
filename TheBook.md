Genesis-Berechshit-Chapter 1

1In the beginning of God's creation of the heavens and the earth.
2Now the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.
3And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
4And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated between the light and between the darkness.
5And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night, and it was evening and it was morning, one day.
6And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water."
7And God made the expanse and it separated between the water that was below the expanse and the water that was above the expanse, and it was so.
8And God called the expanse Heaven, and it was evening, and it was morning, a second day.
9And God said, "Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear," and it was so.
10And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas, and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, seed yielding herbs and fruit trees producing fruit according to its kind in which its seed is found, on the earth," and it was so.
12And the earth gave forth vegetation, seed yielding herbs according to its kind, and trees producing fruit, in which its seed is found, according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.
13And it was evening, and it was morning, a third day.
14And God said, "Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to separate between the day and between the night, and they shall be for signs and for appointed seasons and for days and years.
15And they shall be for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shed light upon the earth." And it was so.
16And God made the two great luminaries: the great luminary to rule the day and the lesser luminary to rule the night, and the stars.
17And God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to shed light upon the earth.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness, and God saw that it was good.
19And it was evening, and it was morning, a fourth day.
20And God said, "Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures, and let fowl fly over the earth, across the expanse of the heavens."
21And God created the great sea monsters, and every living creature that crawls, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged fowl, according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the fowl multiply upon the earth."
23And it was evening, and it was morning, a fifth day.
24And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth according to their kind," and it was so.
25And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind, and all the creeping things of the ground according to their kind, and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven and over the animals and over all the earth and over all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."
27And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
28And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the sky and over all the beasts that tread upon the earth. "
29And God said, "Behold, I have given you every seed bearing herb, which is upon the surface of the entire earth, and every tree that has seed bearing fruit; it will be yours for food.
30And to all the beasts of the earth and to all the fowl of the heavens, and to everything that moves upon the earth, in which there is a living spirit, every green herb to eat," and it was so.
31And God saw all that He had made, and behold it was very good, and it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.

CHAPTER 2

1Now the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.
2And God completed on the seventh day His work that He did, and He abstained on the seventh day from all His work that He did.
3And God blessed the seventh day and He hallowed it, for thereon He abstained from all His work that God created to do.
4These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.
5Now no tree of the field was yet on the earth, neither did any herb of the field yet grow, because the Lord God had not brought rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the soil.
6And a mist ascended from the earth and watered the entire surface of the ground.
7And the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and He breathed into his nostrils the soul of life, and man became a living soul.
8And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden from the east, and He placed there the man whom He had formed.
9And the Lord God caused to sprout from the ground every tree pleasant to see and good to eat, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil.
10And a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated and became four heads.
11The name of one is Pishon; that is the one that encompasses all the land of Havilah, where there is gold.
12And the gold of that land is good; there is the crystal and the onyx stone.
13And the name of the second river is Gihon; that is the one that encompasses all the land of Cush.
14And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is the one that flows to the east of Assyria, and the fourth river that is the Euphrates.
15Now the Lord God took the man, and He placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and to guard it.
16And the Lord God commanded man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat.
17But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die."
18And the Lord God said, "It is not good that man is alone; I shall make him a helpmate opposite him."
19And the Lord God formed from the earth every beast of the field and every fowl of the heavens, and He brought [it] to man to see what he would call it, and whatever the man called each living thing, that was its name.
20And man named all the cattle and the fowl of the heavens and all the beasts of the field, but for man, he did not find a helpmate opposite him.
21And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon man, and he slept, and He took one of his sides, and He closed the flesh in its place.
22And the Lord God built the side that He had taken from man into a woman, and He brought her to man.
23And man said, "This time, it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called ishah (woman) because this one was taken from ish (man)."
24Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
25Now they were both naked, the man and his wife, but they were not ashamed.

CHAPTER 3

1Now the serpent was cunning, more than all the beasts of the field that the Lord God had made, and it said to the woman, "Did God indeed say, 'You shall not eat of any of the trees of the garden?'"
2And the woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat.
3But of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God said, "You shall not eat of it, and you shall not touch it, lest you die.'"
4And the serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die.
5For God knows that on the day that you eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like angels, knowing good and evil."
6And the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise; so she took of its fruit, and she ate, and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
7And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves and made themselves girdles.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God going in the garden to the direction of the sun, and the man and his wife hid from before the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.
9And the Lord God called to man, and He said to him, "Where are you?"
10And he said, "I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I am naked; so I hid."
11And He said, "Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
12And the man said, "The woman whom You gave [to be] with me she gave me of the tree; so I ate."
13And the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent enticed me, and I ate."
14And the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed be you more than all the cattle and more than all the beasts of the field; you shall walk on your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
15And I shall place hatred between you and between the woman, and between your seed and between her seed. He will crush your head, and you will bite his heel."
16To the woman He said, "I shall surely increase your sorrow and your pregnancy; in pain you shall bear children. And to your husband will be your desire, and he will rule over you."
17And to man He said, "Because you listened to your wife, and you ate from the tree from which I commanded you saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed be the ground for your sake; with toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life.
18And it will cause thorns and thistles to grow for you, and you shall eat the herbs of the field.
19With the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, for you were taken therefrom, for dust you are, and to dust you will return."
20And the man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all life.
21And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife shirts of skin, and He dressed them.
22Now the Lord God said, "Behold man has become like one of us, having the ability of knowing good and evil, and now, lest he stretch forth his hand and take also from the Tree of Life and eat and live forever."
23And the Lord God sent him out of the Garden of Eden, to till the soil, whence he had been taken.
24And He drove the man out, and He stationed from the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and the blade of the revolving sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.

The book of JOB

Prologue
1 In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
2 He had seven sons and three daughters,
3 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
4 His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
5 When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.
6 One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
7 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”
8 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”
9 “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied.
10 “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
11 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”
12 The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
13 One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house,
14 a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
15 and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
16 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
17 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
18 While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house,
19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
20 At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
21 and said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart.The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.”
22 In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.

CHAPTER 2

1 On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
2 And the LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”
3 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.”
4 “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life.
5 But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”
6 The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”
7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
9 His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”
10 He replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
11 When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
12 When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.

CHAPTER 3

Job Speaks
1 After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
2 He said:
3 “May the day of my birth perish, and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’
4 That day—may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine on it.
5 May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm it.
6 That night—may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
7 May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
8 May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
9 May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
10 for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
11 “Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
12 Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
13 For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
14 with kings and rulers of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
15 with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
16 Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
17 There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
18 Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout.
19 The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners.
20 “Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
21 to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
22 who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
23 Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
24 For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water.
25 What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
26 I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil.”

---

1Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, and she said, "I have acquired a man with the Lord."
2And she continued to bear his brother Abel, and Abel was a shepherd of flocks, and Cain was a tiller of the soil.
3Now it came to pass at the end of days, that Cain brought of the fruit of the soil an offering to the Lord.
4And Abel he too brought of the firstborn of his flocks and of their fattest, and the Lord turned to Abel and to his offering.
5But to Cain and to his offering He did not turn, and it annoyed Cain exceedingly, and his countenance fell.
6And the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you annoyed, and why has your countenance fallen?
7Is it not so that if you improve, it will be forgiven you? If you do not improve, however, at the entrance, sin is lying, and to you is its longing, but you can rule over it."
8And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.
9And the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
10And He said, "What have you done? Hark! Your brother's blood cries out to Me from the earth.
11And now, you are cursed even more than the ground, which opened its mouth to take your brother's blood from your hand.
12When you till the soil, it will not continue to give its strength to you; you shall be a wanderer and an exile in the land."
13And Cain said to the Lord, "Is my iniquity too great to bear?
14Behold You have driven me today off the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from before You, and I will be a wanderer and an exile in the land, and it will be that whoever finds me will kill me."
15And the Lord said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be wrought upon him sevenfold," and the Lord placed a mark on Cain that no one who find him slay him.
16And Cain went forth from before the Lord, and he dwelt in the land of the wanderers, to the east of Eden.
17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch, and he was building a city, and he called the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
18And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehijael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lemech.
19And Lemech took himself two wives; one was named Adah, and the other was named Zillah.
20Now Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.
21And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who grasp a lyre and a flute.
22And Zillah she too bore Tubal-cain, who sharpened all tools that cut copper and iron, and Tubal-cain's sister was Na'amah.
23Now Lemech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hearken to my voice; wives of Lemech, incline your ears to my words, for I have slain a man by wounding (him) and a child by bruising (him).
24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then for Lemech it shall be seventy seven fold."
25And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and she named him Seth, for God has given me other seed, instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.
26And to Seth also to him a son was born, and he named him Enosh; then it became common to call by the name of the Lord.
